from vid 8 of chp2

npm run node_1
it'll start listening to port 3001 and likewise
npm run node_2 to 5 in diff cmd tabs

=> restart all the  nodes

Go to vid 10 of Chp: Synchronizing and do it all to check for transactions

consensus algo used: longest chain rule
=> takes a look at a single node in the BC
=> compares the length of the chain in the node with all the other nodes' chain lengths
=> if there is a chain file that has a longer length than the length of chain in that node, 
=> replace the chain on that node with the longest chain in the ntk
